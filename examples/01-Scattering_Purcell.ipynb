    "This notebook creates a generalized version of Fig. 4b in [Guillermo F. Peñas et al (2021)](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.17.054038). In that work, Fig. 4b describes the phase shift experienced by a single photon in a quantum link, when scattered by the terminating cavity at the end of the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we generalize the setup, considering that said cavity cavity that is separated from the quantum link by a Purcell filter. The presence of the filter and its coupling with the cavity creates two effective resonances that can be reproduced by a simulation of the scattering process.\n",
